# Shutter Gear Damage Prediction System
This repository contains the code and resources for a system designed to assess the current state of a shutter's gear by analyzing the sound it produces and predicting its lifespan. This project aims to develop a cost-effective and efficient method for monitoring the health of gears and bearings in shutters using voice analysis and neural networks.
